BLOTTO

## Getting Started

First, install the packages and run the development server:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

## DESIGN TODO

- test

- art
  - logo title
  - get all the venues and all the art
  - put a pretty tug of war style art iconography on progress
  - would be fun to have some stats

- simple
  - test progress bar at 0 and 100%
  - make the progress bar actually alive

- contract interaction
  - make stake do something
  - show where you actually staked stuff
  - reflect the contract state (play, or outcome)
  - show the actual live number of soldiers per battle
  - withdraw button for outcome page
