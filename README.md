BLOTTO

## Getting Started

First, install the packages and run the development server:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

## UX

	? chakra ui overrides colorMode and doesn't seem to listen to theme.js settings

	- improve progress bar

	- nav bar should be stickier to the top; not show below

	- the wallet menu is a bit bulky visually

	- tug of war art

	- stats on each item

## contract

	- show juno balance
  - show where you actually staked stuff
  - reflect the contract state (play, or outcome)
  - show the actual live number of soldiers per battle
  - withdraw button for outcome page

## layout
